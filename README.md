# kubech (kubectl change)
Set kubectl contexts/namespaces per shell/terminal to manage multi Kubernetes cluster at the same time.

i.e. same as `kubectx/kubens` but per shell/terminal.

This is a fork of https://github.com/aabouzaid/kubech.

## Acknowledgement 
This is a **fork** of the original kubech repo, i update the original repo to better suit my use-case, so i can't (and don't want to) take credit for the work that had been done by the [author of kubech](https://github.com/aabouzaid). 

All the modifications have been done in a limit time, so i'm sure improvement can still be made. Any PRs or questions are welcome! ;)

## What is the difference between this fork and the original kubech repo?

- Work on both Linux and MacOS (the original repo have some shell commands that are not compliance with BSD (MacOS))
- Some bugs that can occur when kubecontext's name contains special characters like: colon `(:)` or slash `(/)`
- Better consistency of output message when change kube context/namespace

<!-- omit in toc -->
## Prerequisites
- Have kubectl installed
- Have KUBECONFIG predefined in your shell rc. (eg. `export KUBECONFIG=${PATH_TO_KUBECONFIG_1}:${PATH_TO_KUBECONFIG_2}...`)

## Why
- If you manage multi K8s clusters, you will need a handy way to work more than one cluster at the same time.
- [kubectx/kubens](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx) tools fix this problem but globally,
  that means all shells and terminals will have the same context/namespace.
- However, this is not helpful at all if you are actually working with multi clusters at the same time.
- Thus, `kubech` comes to fix this problem so you can set K8s cluster context/namespace per shell/terminal.

## Features
- Each shell/terminal will have its own context (K8s cluster) or namespace!
- Easy to use! Just source it in your favorite shell.
- It works out of the box! No aliases, no extra customizations,
  it doesn't matter if you work with 1 or 100 K8s clusters!
- It still can be used along with other tools like `kubectx/kubens`.
- It doesn't change anything in `~/.kube/config` file.
  So it works perfectly with static and dynamic kube config files.
- It supports extra kubectl config (in addition to `~/.kube/config`).
- It supports autocomplete for contexts and namespaces.

## Install
Clone this repo, then source `kubech` in your shell config file.
```bash or zsh
git clone git@github.com:salutgeek/kubech.git ~/.config/.kubech
```

### Bash
```
echo 'source ~/.config/.kubech/kubech' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'source ~/.config/.kubech/completion/kubech.bash' >> ~/.bashrc
```
### Zsh
Completion for `zsh` with `oh-my-zsh` enabled.
```
ZPLUGINDIR=${ZPLUGINDIR:-${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME/.config/zsh}/plugins};
echo 'source ~/.config/.kubech/kubech' >> ~/.zshrc;
ln -s ~/.config/.kubech/completion/kctx.zsh ${ZPLUGINDIR}/zsh-completions/src/_kctx.zsh;
ln -s ~/.config/.kubech/completion/kns.zsh ${ZPLUGINDIR}/zsh-completions/src/_kns.zsh;
```

Please make sure `autoload -U compinit && compinit` is added to `~/.zshrc` if not please execute below command.
```
echo  'autoload -U compinit && compinit' >> ~/.zshrc
```

## Usage
```
NOTE:
  - The command "kubech" is just a meta for other commands. So kubech does nothing by itself.
  - Also short names like "kctx/kns/kundo" are available.

VARS:
  KUBECONFIG_SRC_DIR  : Set directory with extra kubectl config files to read in kubech commands.
                        This allow to have multiple config files in addition to
                        the one at "$HOME/.kube/config".
                        Default: "$HOME/.kube/config.src.d"
  KUBECONFIG_DEST_DIR : Set directory for temporary kubectl config files. The files
                        in this directory are auto-generated by kubech commands
                        and you don't need to interact with them or even change that var.
                        Default: "$HOME/.kube/config.dest.d"

USAGE:
  kctx                : List all contexts
  kctx <CONTEXT>      : Switch to context <CONTEXT>
  kns                 : List all namespaces
  kns <NAMESPACE>     : Switch to namespace <NAMESPACE>
  kundo               : Unset the active context. This is just a safty net
                        to avoid applying config by mistake to the wrong cluster.
```

### List available contexts
```
$ kctx
k8s_cluster01
k8s_cluster02
```

### Switch context
No need to write the full name, press tab for auto complete.
```
$ kctx k8s_cluster01
```

### List available namespaces
```
$ kns
default
kube-public
kube-system
monitoring
```

### Switch namespace
No need to write the full name, press tab for auto complete.
```
$ kns monitoring
```

## Notes
- This tools has been tested with `zsh 5.8.1` only. However it should work with other shells like `bash`.
- It's recommended to use this tool with [kube-ps1](https://github.com/jonmosco/kube-ps1)
  so current cluster is more visible.
- It's still recommended to have [kubectx/kubens](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx)
  to manage contexts/namespaces globally.

## To-do
- Test it with older `bash` versions like bash v3 on MacOS/Linux
